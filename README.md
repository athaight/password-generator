# password-generator
This is our (The UofA Coding Bootcamp) first homework assignment that utilizes JavaScript. 

This assignment helped to reinforce the concept of for loops, functions, if/else conditionals, and introduced us to the Math function as we used it  for drawing a random string character from several string variables of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, in order to create a new string of the random characters as the generated password. 

This project was useful for gaining exposure to the way JavaScript functions, and helped give us experience using the debugger in Chrome DevTools.

The end result is something rather useful as it randomly creates a password between 8-128 characters long with numbers and special characters
